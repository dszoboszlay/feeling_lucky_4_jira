//  =========================
//
//  Welcome to the Klarna + Flic = Klic Hackathon!
//
//  IMPORTANT!
//  Before you can scan your Flic, you have to add its id to the allow list.
//  In [viewDidLoad] you can add the ID of your button. You can find the ID
//  on the back side of the Flic.
//
//  This example project contains some basic functionality to get you started
//  Once you have your Flic connected, you will start to recieve events.
//  The first thing you want to do is probably to add some logic to this method:
//  - (void)flicButton:(SCLFlicButton *)button didReceiveButtonClick:(BOOL)queued age:(NSInteger)age;
//
//  Detailed documentation can be found at: http://developers.flic.io/
//
//  Good luck and have fun!
